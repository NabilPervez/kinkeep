# KinKeep - Design & Brand Brief for Ad Creative

## 1. Product Overview
**KinKeep** is a **Personal Relationship Manager (PRM)** designed to help thoughtful people maintain better connections with their friends, family, and professional network. 

Think of it as a **"Second Brain" for your social life**. It solves the problem of "forgetting to reach out" by telling you exactly who to contact and when, based on your own rhythm.

### What Makes It Unique?
*   **Local-First & Private:** Unlike social networks or cloud CRMs, KinKeep stores *everything* on your device. Your contacts are yours alone.
*   **Granular "Cadence" Control:** It's not just a contact list. You set specific rhythms for people (e.g., "Mom: Every Sunday," "College Roommate: Every 3 Months").
*   **The "Daily Queue":** The app wakes up and answers one question: *"Who do I need to connect with today?"* removing the mental load of decision-making.

## 2. Visual Identity & Aesthetic
The look and feel of KinKeep is **"Soft Modern, Privacy-First."** It strikes a balance between a high-tech utility tool and a personal, intimate journal.

### Key Visual Pillars
*   **Glassmorphism:** We use extensive "frosted glass" effects (`backdrop-blur`). Panels and cards feel like they are floating above the background, creating depth.
*   **"Aurora" Backgrounds:** The background isn't flat black. It features slowly moving, blurred blobs of color (Teal, Steel Blue, Coral) that look like the Aurora Borealis. This makes the app feel "alive."
*   **Soft Geometry:** There are **no sharp corners**. Buttons, cards, and inputs use heavy rounding (`rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl`), making the UI feel friendly and organic, not corporate.
*   **Dark Mode Native:** While light mode exists, the "true" KinKeep experience is in Dark Mode, where the glowing accents and glass effects pop against the deep background.
